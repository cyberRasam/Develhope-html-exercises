        <h5>Remote work requires a lot of self-motivation 
        and confidence. When you’re in an office environment, you 
        know that you’re there to perform your duties each time you 
        go into work. Working from home means you have to avoid 
        distractions, focus on your job, and set yourself strict 
        rules. </h5>

            Remote working is particularly popular among 
            Millennials, and the digital nomad lifestyle offers many 
            benefits for people that want a different type of 
            lifestyle. But how does this affect management teams? 
            Well, for a start, some people take a very laid back 
            attitude to their remote work and often think that they 
            can put in less effort. Of course, this isn’t the same 
            attitude everyone takes, but it’s something you should 
            be wary of.

            find your next job and tips to stay productive when you 
            work from home. Rob Symington launched Escape the city

            global movement, with over 1 million professionals 
            quitting the corporate world in favor of the flexibility 
            to work anytime, anywhere.
